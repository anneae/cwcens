This pacakage implements non-parametric estimation via a kernel estimator 
for the probability in state and restricted mean time in state in an illness-death 
model under component-wise censoring. Component-wise censoring arises when
illness can only be measured at a finite set of times, while death is right 
censored and thus observed continuously up to the right censoring time. Component-wise 
censored composite endpoints arise often in biostatistical practice. For example, 
in many oncology studies, progression-free survival is component-wise censored. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of cwcens from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anneae/cwcens")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cwcens)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
