# cwcens

This pacakage implements non-parametric estimation via a kernel estimator 
for the probability in state and restricted mean time in state in an
illness-death model under component-wise censoring. Component-wise censoring
arises when illness can only be measured at a finite set of times, while death
is right censored and thus observed continuously up to the right censoring time.
Component-wise censored composite endpoints arise often in biostatistical
practice. For example, in many oncology studies, progression-free survival is
component-wise censored. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of cwcens from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anneae/cwcens")
```
## Irreversible Illness-Death Model Example 

First, we will simulate data from a reversible illness-death model. Our dataset
will contain 200 patients. Visits are scheduled every six months up 
to four years, and actual visit times are scattered around the scheduled visit
times according to a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 10 days.

```{r}
library(cwcens)
irrevdat <- simdat(200, scale12=1/.0008, scale13=1/.0002, scale23=1/.0016,
       scale21=1/.0008, vital.lfu=c(30.4*36, 30.4*48),
       visit.schedule = 30.4*c(12, 24, 36, 48), scatter.sd=10, 
       seed = 123)

head(irrevdat)
```

The dataset `irrevdat` records the time that each visit occurred and the 
individual's current state at each visit. For example, the individual in the
first row of `irrevdat` had visits at `r irrevdat$t1[1]`, `r irrevdat$t2[1]`
and `r irrevdat$t3[1]` days, and their state at those visits was 
`r irrevdat$x1[1]`, `r irrevdat$x2[1]` and `r irrevdat$x3[1]`, respectively,
meaning they were still in state 1 (alive and illness-free) at the third vist.
The individual was right censored at time `r irrevdat$dtime[1]`.

We can estimate the probability of being in each state at 4 years with 
the following code:
```{r}
kernel.est(irrevdat, bandwidth = 30.4*12, tau2 = 30.4*48, prob.times = 30.4*48)
```

We estimate that an individual will be alive and illness-free at 4 years with probability 0.278, alive with illness with probability 0.206, and dead with 
probability 0.516.

Below, we estimate the probability of being in each state over time (at 1, 2, 
..., 1459 days), and plot the results.

```{r}
pmat<-kernel.est(irrevdat, bandwidth = 30.4*12, tau2 = 30.4*48, prob.times = 1:1459)
head(pmat$prob.info)
plot((1:1459)/365.25, pmat$prob.info$p1)
```
Note that the first curve is the event-free survival curve. 

The standard approach to calculating illness-free survival for this type of data
uses the first time illness is *observed* as the date it occurred. If illness
was not observed at a visit, the standard approach assumes it did not happen. 
Thus the 

The kernel approach does not ...

## Reversible Illness-Death Model Example
 Since `scale21` is greater than zero, the true model is reversible, 
meaning individuals can transition back to the illness-free state (state 1) from the 
alive with illness state (state 2). 

```{r}
revdat <- simdat(150, scale12=1/.0008, scale13=1/.0002, scale23=1/.0016,
       scale21=1/.0008, vital.lfu=c(30.4*36, 30.4*48),
       visit.schedule = 30.4*c(12, 24, 36, 48), scatter.sd=10, 
       seed = 111)

head(revdat)
```



The individual in the first row of `revdat` had visits at `r revdat$t1[1]`, 
`r revdat$t2[1]` and `r revdat$t3[1]` days, and their state at those visits was 
`r revdat$x1[1]`, `r revdat$x2[1]` and `r revdat$x3[1]`, respectively,
meaning that
illness developed between the first and second visit, and the illness cleared up
between the second and third visit. The individual then died at time 
`r revdat$dtime[1]`.

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
