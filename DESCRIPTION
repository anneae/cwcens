Title: Estimation for Component-Wise Censored Data from an Illness-Death Model
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Anne Eaton
Maintainer: Anne Eaton <eato0055@umn.edu>
Description: This pacakage implements non-parametric estimation via a kernel estimator 
  for the probability in state and restricted mean time in state in an illness-death 
  model under component-wise censoring. Component-wise censoring arises when
  illness can only be measured at a finite set of times, while death is right 
  censored and thus observed continuously up to the right censoring time. Component-wise 
  censored composite endpoints arise often in biostatistical practice. For example, 
  in many oncology studies, progression-free survival is component-wise censored.
